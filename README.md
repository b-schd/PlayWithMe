# PlayWithMe

This repository contains a collection of interactive scripts for immersive learning. Most of the scripts are slightly modified from examples I've used to build an intuition for myself, my peers, and my students on a variety of concepts. 

### File Overview

* _wavelet explorations_: visualize and play with the wavelet transform, wavelet coherence, and cross wavelet transforms between pairs of signals. 
* _lagged correlation and noisy signals_: manipulate lagged correlations and visualize noise removal

### Requirements

Matlab2016+, (requires MATLAB live scripts)
